# The Windows Graphics Repository

This repository is a Visual Studio 2019 solution composed of several projects that bring together Windows graphics programming using C++ and DirectX11. The projects are work in progress but in there are tangible applications that show how to write graphics code.

NOTE: Much of it is disorganized. With more complete code I will write up what to do with the parts. It is advisable one browse the code but not check-out to build. -- _13 July 2020_ 

## Projects

* __Win32__ - The bare minimum code needed to write a Windows application. This goal is to make this project a useful reference for Windows programming.
* __draw__ - A 2D graphics framework using Direct2D.
* __world__ - A 3D real-time rendering framework using DirectX11.
